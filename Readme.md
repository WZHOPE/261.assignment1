# Introduction
This is a simple snake game. It has two snakes for two players:  
Player1: Red Head, Green body; Control: W, A, S, D  
Player2: Green Head, Red body; Control: Arrow keys

# How to run
If both snakes die or one of them reaches 17 points, the game ends. There is no feature to set up a restart, so the player only has one chance.

# Additional Features
- Double snakes
- Setting up a Menu Bar with different options: Start Game, Help, Quit Game
- Game boundaries
